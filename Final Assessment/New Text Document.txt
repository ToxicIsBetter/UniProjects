Different Phases of the Data Science Lifecycle
1. Acquire Data
Data Sourcing: Identify and access relevant data from various sources such as SQL databases, APIs, NoSQL storage, and traditional databases.
Data Extraction: Retrieve the necessary data in a suitable format to support subsequent analysis.
2. Prepare Data
Statistical Summary: Calculate summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles) to understand the data's distribution.
Visualization: Use visual tools such as histograms, scatter plots, heat maps, box plots, and line graphs to explore trends, correlations, and outliers.
Data Cleaning:
Handle data quality issues like missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers.
Apply domain knowledge to address invalid data and noise.
Data Transformation:
Normalize and scale data.
Perform feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and other manipulations to prepare data for analysis.
3. Analyze Data
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights through visualizations and statistical summaries to inform further modeling steps.
Model Building:
Select appropriate machine learning or analytical techniques (e.g., regression, classification, clustering, association analysis, graph analytics).
Train and validate the model.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's quality and reliability using relevant metrics to determine if further refinement is needed.
4. Report Insights
Data Visualization: Present findings using visual tools for clarity and impact.
Storytelling: Clearly communicate insights in a structured and compelling way, tailored to the audience.
Report Generation: Produce formal reports or presentations that summarize key results and recommendations.
5. Act on Insights
Decision Making: Use insights to guide business decisions or actions.
Model Deployment: Implement the model in a production environment, such as a web application, API, or batch processing system.
Monitoring and Feedback: Continuously evaluate model performance and refine the approach when necessary.
